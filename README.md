Aight welcome to Bored Designer people. My child if you may, the one ill overwork for my own personal gains aka designing and illustrating
(I have personal agendas behind everything)

What is this?

Well this is a Saas which will give you a alluring button which once inevitably pressed will randomize
* Primary Font (from google fonts API)
* Secondary Font (same place)
* Color Pallete of 5 colors (generated runtime and converted into hex)
* A randomized color map showing the screen space/ visual distribution of said colors (css maps from which random ones are dynamically imported)
* Two images to provide a mood (lorem picsum API)
* One image of a random texture (A public dataset of texuture images)
* Aaaand one image of a random shape to help with the shape Language (self made)

You can lock components you like and keep randomizing before youre happy with what you got

User creation auth and ability to save and export boards as well as well (obviously)

Why?
Why not. I need it. There is no such thing I found. Even if there is, I did it too. I draw and design too and some other people do too so your welcome guys.

How?
The backend is on ASP .NET the frontend sits in React and SQL for the database. Traditional hehe

Why Bored Designer?
Its a pun. I know it barely lands it's like "Board" Designer but youre bored because you need inspiration.. For which you will use this.. I will show myself out

Below are the Logs (Not from day one but better late than never)
* Day -n to 1
I spent hours trying to set this up with no prior knowledge of .NET.
I waltz through a .NET crash course to get a feel of how it looks like with respect to node (far scarier I came to learn)
I jumped in head first into the concrete and tried to make something that work migrations and all errors solved :D
hello world never felt so rewarding
create react app acting moody wth
all done first route said and im asking gpt to tutor me about everything I need to know
MVC set up
front-end directory not comitting wth
All goofy errors fixed what we have is
  * Generate button randomizes and loads everything
  * Board model and component made which will be made to lock and save soon
  * DASHING Ui design created by yours truly
